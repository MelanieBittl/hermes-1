Linux

Using standard Debian packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For sequential version, install packages `libmumps-seq-4.9.2` and `libmumps-seq-dev`. 
For parallel version, install `libmumps-4.9.2` and `libmumps-dev`. Newer versions 
may be available. In Ubuntu 6.06 (Dapper)
or newer, you can use the Synaptic package manager for that, or type::

   sudo apt-get install libmumps-seq-4.9.2 libmumps-seq-dev

for the sequential version and
::

   sudo apt-get install libmumps-4.9.2 libmumps-dev
   
for the parallel one.

Now go to the directory with Hermes. Create the file CMake.vars with the
following line (or append to the existing one)::

  set(WITH_MUMPS YES)

Finally execute::
  
  rm CMakeCache.txt
  cmake .
  make

Using the special Hermes/Femhub package
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    `Tutorial Video <http://hpfem.org/hermes/doc/src/installation/matrix_solvers/videos.html#>`_. 

Download the software package from the `solvers repository`_ and unpack 
it in some temporary directory:

.. sourcecode::
   .  

   wget https://github.com/downloads/hpfem/solvers/mumps-4.9.2.spkg --no-check-certificate
   tar -jxvf mumps-4.9.2.spkg
   rm mumps-4.9.2.spkg
   cd mumps-4.9.2

.. latexcode::
   .  

   wget https://github.com/downloads/hpfem/solvers/mumps-4.9.2.spkg
   --no-check-certificate
   tar -jxvf mumps-4.9.2.spkg
   rm mumps-4.9.2.spkg
   cd mumps-4.9.2

In order to install the library into say ``~/solvers/mumps`` (you may choose any
path you like, provided that you have write access to it; the target directory 
will be created if it doesn't exist), type now into the terminal::

  ./standalone-install ~/solvers/mumps

For advanced configuration possibilities, please read the `manual`_ or visit the
`MUMPS home page`_.

Once the library has been built and installed, you may delete the temporary 
directory with the unpacked package to save some disk space or 
just remove the object files by running

::

  cd src
  make clean 

Now go to the directory with Hermes. Create the file CMake.vars with the
following lines (or append to the existing one)::

  set(WITH_MUMPS YES)
  set(MUMPS_ROOT ~/solvers/mumps) #(or your own installation destination)

Finally execute::
  
  rm CMakeCache.txt
  cmake .
  make
