    *  \brief Adaptivity provides framework for modifying elements in order to decrease errors of the solution.
    *
    *  Adaptivity classes calculate error of every element.
    *  An error of an element is calculated either by comparing a
    *  coarse solution with a reference solution or by evaluating
    *  suitable error estimate. Errors of
    *  elements define the order in which elements are examined.
    *  During examining an element, a refinement is proposed
    *  and the element is refined if applicable. The refinement
    *  is proposed through refinement selectors, see \ref g_selectors.
